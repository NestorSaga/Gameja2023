    mean your brother? Well... this. We need equipment and you better help us buy
    it '
  - 'We''d like to make better shoes, and to make them faster. I can''t help but
    lament when all these cheap shoemakers charge for those crappy shoes, made with
    crappy materials. So please, help us to be able to sell our good shoes to everyone. '
  - There's an empty plot of land next to ours, and we'd like to buy it. However,
