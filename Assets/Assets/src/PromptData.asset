  - You'll listen and say 'yes' because we just deserve it.
  - Hello. I hope you're able to help us.
  - Thank you for letting me come here to talk to you, o dragon and shark!
  _identity:
  - Let me tell you who we are.
  - We'll introduce ourselves.
  - You should already know who we are but I'll remind you.
  - Let me introduce the business.
  - I'll tell you who we are.

  - Please let me introduce myself and my family.
  - Please, allow us to introduce ourselves and present our excellent idea.
  _institution:
  - I come in the name of the highly respected Magicians and Alchemists guild.
  - My son and I are the best fishermen in the zone! I fish the biggest, the tastiest
    fishes!
  - We are the Pure Flame Church.
  - 'We are the army of the Lotus Reign, the biggest and most powerful one in here '
  - 'We are a simple leatherworker family. My granfather''s grandfather founded it,
    and now we''re going through a bit of a rough patch. '
  - 'We''re the oldest and best beer producers in all of the zone. Our beer is drank
    by all of the kings in here '
  - 'We are scientists that want to better this world. We don''t want to be rich,
    just to advance our society. '
  - 'We are the best adventurers on this world.  '
  - 'We are a family of traditional shoemakers. '
  - 'We are just humble farmers that want to grow more crops. '
  - We are the holy order of the cum grail.
  - We are a team of crewmates and we think there is an impostor.
  _idea:
  - 'We have stumbled upon a way to turn lead into gold, so we came seeking an investment
    We want to refine our formula so we can comercialize it. Of course, such a discovery
    will only be accessible to the most exclusive people! We now need an investment
    to continue with our investigations.  '
  - 'And now? Now we discovered an even BIGGER and TASTIER fish! But it is complicated
    to fish. we need a special rode and the fucker broke the last one, a bigger boat,
    men to help me. Will ya'' help us, mate? '
  - 'We want to start doing theatre plays to entertain and teach our devotees. We
    need to build a stage on one of our churches, and get the needed equipment to
    be able to have good plays, and not just people reading a text. '
  - 'We need to investigate more ways of winning wars. We discovered a new substance
    to use in our wars. It''s so flammable that it burns even inside the water '
  - 'However, we discovered a new way to treat leather, so it will be easier and
    faster, and less damaging for the product. Now we can make a chest armor in less
    than a week, when before at best we''d take two weeks to do it. '
  - 'And now we can do more beer, and not only more... but better! We are faster
    and better at it, even better than my granfather, the most famous beer-maker
    EVER on this place. '
  - 'We found a way to cure the Black Plague. However it''s still pretty primitive,
    so it needs a lot more refinement. '
  - 'We were, in fact, thinking of going adventuring and all this... However we don''t
    have our weapons. Eh... that''s embarrassing, we didn''t lose them! What do you
    mean your brother? Well... this. We need equipment and you better help us buy
    it '
  - 'We''d like to make better shoes, and to make them faster. I can''t help but
    lament when all these cheap shoemakers charge for those crappy shoes, made with
    crappy materials. So please, help us to be able to sell our good shoes to everyone. '
  - 'There''s an empty plot of land next to ours, and we''d like to buy it. However,
    at the start of the season we spent all of our savings on the crops and a bull.
    We''d need a bit more money to buy that land. '
  - We want to make a feet rating business.
